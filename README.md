# Battle Frieza


### Made with JavaScript, jQuery, HTML5 - Canvas, CSS3

The evil tyrant, Frieza, has ruled the galaxy for hundreds of years. Known for his ruthlessness and unparalled power, Frieza and his personal army travel from planet to planet, wiping out the native inhabitants before selling the cleansed world to the highest bidder. You are Vegeta, Prince of all Saiyans, and the one of the last remaining Saiyans left after Frieza blew up your planet decades ago. After living under Frieza's rule for years in order to survive, you've managed to obtain enough power to finally defeat the monster that destroyed your homeworld.
